Perfect ‚Äî since you already have your environment ready and you‚Äôll be working on **Databricks as a Data Engineer**, you don‚Äôt need to waste time on basic CS theory or Python tricks. You need to focus on **the Python that‚Äôs used daily for ETL, data cleaning, data pipelines, and notebooks**.

Here‚Äôs a **7-day focused Python syllabus** made **only for data engineers** ‚Äî practical, fast, and Databricks-oriented üëá

## üß† **7-Day Python for Data Engineering (Databricks-Focused) Syllabus**

### **Day 1: Python Basics for Data Work**

**Goal:** Be comfortable writing and running Python scripts.

**Topics**

* Variables, data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`)
* Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
* Type conversion and formatted printing (f-strings)
* Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
* Loops (`for`, `while`)
* Functions (`def`, return values, parameters)
* Practice:

  * Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns even ones.
  * Use loops to print tables, calculate averages, etc.

---

### **Day 2: File Handling & Working with Data**

**Goal:** Learn to read/write data like CSV, JSON, TXT ‚Äî essential for ETL.

**Topics**

* Reading/writing text and CSV files with built-in `open()`
* The `csv` module (reader/writer)
* Working with `json` module
* Path handling using `os` and `pathlib`
* Exception handling (`try`, `except`)
* Practice:

  * Read a CSV, clean nulls, and save to another CSV.
  * Write logs to text files.

---

### **Day 3: Pandas & Data Manipulation**

**Goal:** Master the heart of data engineering ‚Äî Pandas.

**Topics**

* Creating DataFrames and reading CSV/Excel/JSON
* Selecting, filtering, and sorting data
* Adding/removing columns
* GroupBy, aggregation, merging, concatenation
* Handling missing data
* Applying lambda functions
* Practice:

  * Read a dataset, clean it, and calculate aggregations (e.g., sales by region).
  * Export final output as a new file.

---

### **Day 4: Numpy & Date/Time Handling**

**Goal:** Efficient numerical and date operations.

**Topics**

* Numpy arrays, indexing, broadcasting
* Vectorized operations (sum, mean, reshape)
* Using `datetime` and `dateutil` for date parsing
* Pandas datetime features (converting, filtering, resampling)
* Practice:

  * Calculate monthly average sales from daily data.
  * Work with arrays for batch transformations.

---

### **Day 5: Working with APIs, Databases & PySpark**

**Goal:** Learn to connect Python with data sources (Databricks style).

**Topics**

* `requests` module for REST APIs
* Parse JSON API responses into Pandas DataFrame
* Basic `sqlite3` usage (connect, read/write)
* Intro to PySpark:

  * Create SparkSession
  * Read CSV/Parquet
  * Filter, select, groupBy
  * Save DataFrames
* Practice:

  * Call a public API, transform JSON, save as Parquet.
  * Run small PySpark jobs locally.

---

### **Day 6: Databricks & Real-World Data Pipelines**

**Goal:** Combine everything ‚Äî create mini ETL pipelines.

**Topics**

* Databricks notebook structure and `%python` cells
* Mounting and reading data from DBFS / Azure / AWS
* Transforming data with PySpark
* Writing cleaned data to Delta tables
* Automating scripts with functions
* Practice:

  * Read raw CSV ‚Üí Clean & Transform ‚Üí Save as Delta.

---

### **Day 7: Automation, Logging, and Best Practices**

**Goal:** Make your Python code production-ready.

**Topics**

* Using `logging` module for pipeline logs
* Scheduling/Automation basics (`cron`, Databricks Jobs)
* Writing reusable modules and functions
* Environment variables with `os.environ`
* Error handling and debugging tips
* Code readability (PEP-8 basics)
* Practice:

  * Write a full ETL script with logging and exception handling.
  * Document it clearly.
